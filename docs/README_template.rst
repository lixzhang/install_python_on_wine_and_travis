Installation and Prerequisites
------------------------------

.. include:: ./installation.rst


Install WINE
============

.. code-block:: bash


    # set the wine_version from Your command prompt
    export wine_version="stable"     # for wine version stable, somehow old
    export wine_version="devel"      # for wine version development, recommended
    export wine_version="staging"    # for wine version staging, the newest version, might be unstable

    # next step will install wine - after that You will be able to set up 32 and 64 Bit Wine Machines
    install_wine.sh


Set up Wine Machine
===================

you can set up as many Wine Machines as You want, with different settings, by selecting different WINEPREFIX

The WINEPREFIX is the path to the Wine machine, defaults to /home/<user>/.wine



.. code-block:: bash

    #############################################
    # Install Wine Machine 1 (32 Bit)
    #############################################
    # set Wine Prefix for Machine 1 (32 Bit)
    export WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine32_machine_01
    # set Architecture to 32 Bit
    export WINEARCH="win32"
    # set wine_windows_version to report, defaults to "win10"
    # possible values: win10, win2k, win2k3, win2k8, win31, win7, win8, win81, win95, win98, winxp
    export wine_windows_version="win10"
    # next step is to set up the wine machine
    install_wine_machine.sh

    #############################################
    # Install Wine Machine 2 (64 Bit)
    #############################################
    # set Wine Prefix for Machine 2 (64 Bit)
    export WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine64_machine_02
    # set Architecture to 64 Bit
    export WINEARCH=""
    # set wine_windows_version to report, defaults to "win10"
    # possible values: win10, win2k, win2k3, win2k8, win31, win7, win8, win81, win95, win98, winxp
    export wine_windows_version="win10"
    # next step is to set up the wine machine
    install_wine_machine.sh


Install latest Python 2.7 on WINE
=================================

you should install a 32 Bit Python on a 32 Bit Wine Machine, and 64 Bit Python on a 64 Bit Wine Machine.
Other combinations will probably not work.
The path setting in the registry of the wine machine will be adapted to point to the python 2.7 directories


.. code-block:: bash

    #############################################
    # install python 2.7 32 Bit Version on Machine 1
    #############################################
    # set Wine Prefix for Machine 1 (32 Bit)
    export WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine32_machine_01
    # set Architecture to 32 Bit
    export WINEARCH="win32"
    # next step is to install python 2.7 on the Wine Machine
    install_win_python2_preinstalled.sh

    #############################################
    # install python 2.7 64 Bit Version on Machine 2
    #############################################
    # set Wine Prefix for Machine 2 (64 Bit)
    export WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine64_machine_02
    # set Architecture to 64 Bit
    export WINEARCH=""
    # next step is to install python 2.7 on the Wine Machine
    install_win_python2_preinstalled.sh



Install latest Python 3.7 on WINE
=================================

you should install a 32 Bit Python on a 32 Bit Wine Machine, and 64 Bit Python on a 64 Bit Wine Machine.
Other combinations will probably not work.
The path setting in the registry of the wine machine will be adapted to point to the python 3.7 directories
You CAN install Python 2.7 and 3.7 on the same WINE Machine, although the paths will point to the version installed at last.

.. code-block:: bash

    #############################################
    # install python 3.7 32 Bit Version on Machine 1
    #############################################
    # set Wine Prefix for Machine 1 (32 Bit)
    export WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine32_machine_01
    # set Architecture to 32 Bit
    export WINEARCH="win32"
    # next step is to install python 3.7 on the Wine Machine
    install_win_python3_preinstalled.sh

    #############################################
    # install python 3.7 64 Bit Version on Machine 2
    #############################################
    # set Wine Prefix for Machine 2 (64 Bit)
    export WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine64_machine_02
    # set Architecture to 64 Bit
    export WINEARCH=""
    # next step is to install python 3.7 on the Wine Machine
    install_win_python3_preinstalled.sh


Install GIT on WINE
===================


.. code-block:: bash

    #############################################
    # install Git 32 Bit Version on Machine 1
    #############################################
    # set Wine Prefix for Machine 1 (32 Bit)
    export WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine32_machine_01
    # set Architecture to 32 Bit
    export WINEARCH="win32"
    # next step is to install Git 32 Bit on the Wine Machine
    install_wine_git_portable.sh

    #############################################
    # install Git 64 Bit Version on Machine 2
    #############################################
    # set Wine Prefix for Machine 2 (64 Bit)
    export WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine64_machine_02
    # set Architecture to 64 Bit
    export WINEARCH=""
    # next step is to install Git 64 Bit on the Wine Machine
    install_wine_git_portable.sh


Running Commands on Wine
========================


.. code-block:: bash

    #############################################
    # Running Commands on Machine 1
    #############################################
    # set Wine Prefix for Machine 1 (32 Bit)
    export WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine32_machine_01
    # test if it is working
    wine pip install --upgrade pip
    # alternatively a one-liner, handy for Icons:
    WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine32_machine_01 wine pip install --upgrade pip
    # opening wineconsole
    wineconsole

    #############################################
    # Running Commands on Machine 2
    #############################################
    # set Wine Prefix for Machine 2 (64 Bit)
    export WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine64_machine_02
    # test if it is working
    wine pip install --upgrade pip
    # alternatively a one-liner, handy for Icons:
    WINEPREFIX=${HOME}/wine/wine64_machine_02 wine pip install --upgrade pip
    # opening wineconsole
    wineconsole
